        <h1>GAMELANG : an overview</h1>
        <div id="tutorialContent">
        Hi! This is meant as an introduction / explanation for my proof-of-concept language: <strong>GAMELANG</strong><br>
        Let's start with the basics:<br>
            <div id="section">
                <p id="sectionTitle">Whitespace</p>
                Spaces are the foundation of parsing for this language, an item (or "token") to be distinguishable from its neighbours must be well spaced out on both sides.<br>
                That said indentation is instead irrelevant, just like the <strong>amount</strong> of spaces you leave around your tokens.
            </div>

            <div id="section">
                <p id="sectionTitle">Types</p>
                GAMELANG is a dynamicly typed, interpreted and synchronous language with only four proper primitive types:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>NUMBER</strong> - GAMELANG does not distinguish between numbers and booleans, namely:
                        0 ←→ false,<br> 1 ←→ true.
                    </li>
                    
                    <li>
                        <strong>STRING</strong> - Currently, support for escaping characters is limited to "&new",
                        which replaces the much more common "\n".
                        <div class="codeSnippet"><pre>
                            \"Hello, World!&newWhat's up?" # >> Hello, World!
                            \                              # What's up?
                        </pre></div>
                    </li>
                    
                    <li>
                        <strong>LIST</strong> - A collection of indexable items, of any type (even other lists).
                    </li>
                    
                    <li>
                        <strong>OBJECT</strong> - A collection of "property : value" pairs that have to be indexed by name and are not positional.
                        Object properties are more precisely called "methods" if their access operation corresponds to a "Function call", but we'll get
                        to that later.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                What you can also notice is the absence of a <strong>NULL</strong> type of sorts. In fact, such values aren't allowed in the language and while it's possible
                to create an empty string ("") similar structures for other types, such as an empty list ([]) or object ({}), are impossible to obtain.
            </div>

            <div id="section">
                <p id="sectionTitle">Expressions</p>
                Any line of code written in GAMELANG is called an <strong>Expression</strong>, of which there are 3 valid types:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Procedures:</strong> a procedure, like any other expression, follows a specific pattern of arguments and
                        syntactic rules. Most notably, it always begins with a <strong>keyword</strong>.<br>
                        This is a list of all currently available keywords:
                        <table><tr>
                            <td width="15%">
                                <ul class="chapterList">
                                    <li class="chapter procKeyword" selected="true">print</li>
                                    <li class="chapter procKeyword">make    </strong></li>
                                    <li class="chapter procKeyword">free    </strong></li>
                                    <li class="chapter procKeyword">when    </strong></li>
                                    <li class="chapter procKeyword">else    </strong></li>
                                    <li class="chapter procKeyword">options </strong></li>
                                    <li class="chapter procKeyword">loop    </strong></li>
                                    <li class="chapter procKeyword">next    </strong></li>
                                    <li class="chapter procKeyword">exit    </strong></li>
                                    <li class="chapter procKeyword">def     </strong></li>
                                    <li class="chapter procKeyword">use     </strong></li>
                                    <li class="chapter procKeyword">with    </strong></li>
                                    <li class="chapter procKeyword">replace </strong></li>
                                    <li class="chapter procKeyword">flag    </strong></li>
                                </ul>
                            </td>

                            <td>
                                <div class="insertContent" id="CHAPTERCONTAINER-procedures"><div id="innerContainer">
                                    <div id="print" style="display: inline;">
                                        <strong>Syntax: </strong><font class="definition">&ltPrint&gt := print &ltStackExpression&gt</font><br>
                                        <strong>Usage:  </strong> Prints its value to the console.<br><br>

                                        This is the first procedure we tackle, so let's begin by looking at a couple examples:<br>
                                        <div class="codeSnippet"><pre>
                                            \print 2               # this value is a NUMBER
                                            \print "Hello, World!" # this value is a STRING
                                            \print 1 2 "hi" 3      # these values are MANY >> [ 1, 2, hi, 3 ]
                                        </pre></div><br>
                                        As you can see in example #3, multiple values can share the same space with no separators.
                                        Moreover, since we aren't performing any operations on them we're left with many values to process,
                                        and when this happens what you obtain is a <strong>LIST</strong>. To understand why this happens, we need to talk
                                        about the only (not entirely true) argument this procedure takes in: a <strong>stack expression</strong>.<br><br>

                                        Stack expressions are the way values are created, changed and manipulated in this language. Anytime a value is written,
                                        transferred, changed, calculated or even taken as an input from the user, it's bound to pass through a stack expression..
                                        so how does it work?<br>
                                        Every time a stack expression argument is executed, 3 things happen in order:<br>
                                        <div class="manualList">
                                            1) An empty stack is created. A <strong>stack</strong> in computer science is a very common abstract data structure defined as a pile 
                                            of elements that can only be accessed from its "top", removing or adding one element at a time. In this particular implementation, many more
                                            operations are possible, however the core limitation of not being able to access any of the elements at a moment's notice is still present, and
                                            it makes for an original and compelling coding style.
                                            <br><br>
                                            
                                            2) All the items in the stack expression are evaluated in writing order. A direct consequence of using a stack to store values is what's known in
                                            Mathematics as <strong>Reverse Polish Notation</strong>, a particular way of writing expressions where each operator goes after all of its operands.<br>
                                            This means that to perform an addition we must first push both inputs on the stack, and only then the "+" follows.<br>
                                            Reverse polish notation ensures linear priority in evaluating mathematical and logical operations, making them always inequivocably objective.
                                            How many times have people been fooled by "simple operations" such as this one: <strong>1 + 12 / 2 * 3</strong> ? Does this equal 19 or 3? Depends who you ask,
                                            because "/" is a terrible way of indicating division given it's <strong>unclear</strong> what the numerator and denominator are.
                                            Most programming languages solve this problem by relying on parentheses, forcing you to use them everywhere in fear of messing up the
                                            order of operations in complex expressions. Here there are no parentheses, you don't need them, priority is <strong>linear</strong>.
                                            <br><br>
                                            
                                            3) What remains in the stack is "dumped" into its container element, which in this case is the print procedure. The so-called "dumping" phase does
                                            different things based on the amount of elements left on the stack: since there is no NULL type no stack expression is ever allowed to end its evaluation
                                            empty, but besides that everytime the output of a stack expression is comprised of multiple elements it gets automatically cast to a LIST.
                                        </div>
                                        <div class="deeper">Going deeper:</div> the optional syntax: <font class="definition">&ltPrint&gt := print &ltStackExpression&gt with &ltStackExpression&gt</font>
                                        allows you to style the printed text to some degree, here's how:
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>The stack expression containing style specifications must evaluate to a string to be valid.</li>
                                            <li>A valid style-string starts with a colour, which can be either in full hexadecimal notation (#rrbbgg) or written with its common name.
                                            This last approach, although valid, is discouraged because I can't be bothered to waste space listing all the available colours.
                                            </li>
                                            <li>After the colour has been specified, there are a few modifiers you can add to your string (in no particular order), separated from
                                                the colour and each other by a space:
                                                <ul>
                                                    <li><strong>bold</strong></li>
                                                    <li><i>italic</i></li>
                                                    <li><u>underline</u></li>
                                                </ul>
                                            </li>
                                        </ul>
                                        Here's how an example featuring all the styling options might look like:
                                        <div class="codeSnippet"><pre>
                                            \print "Hello, world!" with "red bold italic underline"
                                        </pre></div>
                                    </div>

                                    <div id="make" style="display: none">
                                        <strong>Syntax: </strong><font class="definition">&ltMake&gt := make &ltAssignment&gt </font><br>
                                        <strong>Usage:  </strong> Creates a new variable.<br><br>

                                        If you take a peek further down in this chapter about expressions, you will find that assignments are, just like procedures,
                                        a valid expression type. For this very reason we won't spend too much time explaining how this procedure's only argument works
                                        in detail, but in a nutshell an assignment follows this syntax:<br>
                                        <font class="definition">&ltAssignment&gt := &ltTarget&gt &ltAssignmentSymbol&gt &ltStackExpression&gt</font><br>
                                        Where the <strong>target</strong>, for simplicity, can be interpreted as the name you want to give to your variable. To be exact,
                                        you could also assign values to properties inside of an object or to specific elements inside a list, however this is not allowed in
                                        a make procedure, whose only purpose is to create a new, indipendent piece of data.<br><br>

                                        There are 2 more things regarding assignments that you have to watch out for when using a make procedure:
                                        <ul>
                                            <li><strong>Strict assignment</strong> - the simplest kind of assignment, where the so-called <strong>assignment symbol</strong>
                                            is "=", and the only one allowed in make procedures. Without going into too much detail, any non-strict assignment needs its target
                                            argument to already have a value to start from so that it can get modified, and this is obviously not possible if the variable hasn't
                                            been fully declared yet.
                                            </li>
                                            
                                            <li><strong>Implicit assignment</strong> - by omitting the assignment symbol and the stack expression, the value of your newly created
                                            variable is automatically set to 0. This is simply syntax sugar that looks no different from any other strict assignment to zero after the
                                            parsing phase, and while nothing "logically" stops this from existing even outside of make procedures, I feel like an expression only containing
                                            one word (the name of your variable) would be ugly and unclear.
                                            </li>
                                        </ul>
                                        
                                        With all this in mind, let's see some examples:<br>
                                        <div class="codeSnippet"><pre>

                                        One last thing: we've learned that we can control both the name and the value of any variable we create, however variables also have a third parameter
                                        called "depth", which simply refers to the <strong>scope</strong> they were created in. So far, all the variables we can declare are part of the so-called
                                        <strong>global</strong> scope, because to be fair we don't even know what a scope is... let's change that. A scope is simply the space enclosed by a 
                                        <strong>block</strong>, an argument common to many procedures we have yet to see and that is defined as:
                                        <font class="definition">&ltBlock&gt := { ( &ltExpression&gt )* }</font> , so basically a chunk of code within curly brackets.<br>
                                        Every time a block is opened a private scope is created, and any variable declared inside of it will have a depth equal to how many levels of nesting separate
                                        it from the global scope. Furthermore, when the block closes all the variables that were declared inside of it are automatically deleted, they disappear together with their scope.
                                        In a practical sense, this means that wherever you are in your code you are only allowed to access variables whose depth is bigger or equal to the current scope, 
                                        or in other words "less private" variables.<br>
                                        This is important because it's not possible to have two variables with the same name <strong>defined in the same scope</strong>, but when legal name collisions do occur
                                        the program will always prioritize the variable with the most depth:<br>
                                        <div class="codeSnippet"><pre>
                                            \make a = 14  # depth : global(0)
                                            \make a = 15  # this is not allowed! this new "a" is in the same scope as another 
                                            \             # variable with the same name
                                            \
                                            \{ # you are not actually allowed to treat blocks as expressions, just imagine this is a private scope
                                            \
                                            \   print a      # >> 14
                                            \   make  a = 26 # this is fine, this new "a" has a depth of 1
                                            \   print a      # >> 26 , the more private "a" is prioritized
                                            \}
                                            \
                                            \print a # >> 14 , the other "a" was deleted when the block closed
