        <h1>GAMELANG : an overview</h1>
        <div id="tutorialContent">
        Hi! This is meant as an introduction / explanation for my proof-of-concept language: <strong>GAMELANG</strong><br>
        Let's start with the basics:<br>
            <div id="section">
                <p id="sectionTitle">Whitespace</p>
                Spaces are the foundation of parsing for this language, an item (or "token") to be distinguishable from its neighbours must be well spaced out on both sides.<br>
                That said indentation is instead irrelevant, just like the <strong>amount</strong> of spaces you leave around your tokens.
            </div>

            <div id="section">
                <p id="sectionTitle">Types</p>
                GAMELANG is a dynamicly typed, interpreted and synchronous language with only four proper primitive types:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>NUMBER</strong> - GAMELANG does not distinguish between numbers and booleans, namely:<br>
                        0 ←→ false , 1 ←→ true.
                    </li>
                    
                    <li>
                        <strong>STRING</strong> - Currently, support for escaping characters is limited to "&new",
                        which replaces the much more common "\n".
                        <div class="codeSnippet"><pre>
                            "Hello, World!&newWhat's up?" # >> Hello, World!
                                                          #    What's up?
                        </pre></div>
                    </li>
                    
                    <li>
                        <strong>LIST</strong> - A collection of indexable items, of any type (even other lists).
                    </li>
                    
                    <li>
                        <strong>OBJECT</strong> - A collection of "property : value" pairs that have to be indexed by name and are not positional.<br>
                        Object properties are more precisely called "methods" if their access operation corresponds to a "Function call", but we'll get
                        to that later.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                What you can also notice is the absence of a <strong>NULL</strong> type of sorts. In fact, such values aren't allowed in the language and while it's possible
                to create an empty string ("") similar structures for other types, such as an empty list ([]) or object ({}), are impossible to obtain.
            </div>

            <div id="section">
                <p id="sectionTitle">Expressions</p>
                Any line of code written in GAMELANG is called an <strong>Expression</strong>, of which there are 3 valid types:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Procedures:</strong> a procedure, like any other expression, follows a specific pattern of arguments and
                        syntactic rules. Most notably, it always begins with a <strong>keyword</strong>.<br>
                        This is a list of all currently available keywords:
                        <table><tr>
                            <td width="15%">
                                <ul class="chapterList">
                                    <li class="chapter" selected="true"><strong class="procKeyword">print</strong></li>
                                    <li class="chapter"><strong class="procKeyword">make    </strong></li>
                                    <li class="chapter"><strong class="procKeyword">free    </strong></li>
                                    <li class="chapter"><strong class="procKeyword">when    </strong></li>
                                    <li class="chapter"><strong class="procKeyword">else    </strong></li>
                                    <li class="chapter"><strong class="procKeyword">options </strong></li>
                                    <li class="chapter"><strong class="procKeyword">loop    </strong></li>
                                    <li class="chapter"><strong class="procKeyword">next    </strong></li>
                                    <li class="chapter"><strong class="procKeyword">exit    </strong></li>
                                    <li class="chapter"><strong class="procKeyword">def     </strong></li>
                                    <li class="chapter"><strong class="procKeyword">use     </strong></li>
                                    <li class="chapter"><strong class="procKeyword">with    </strong></li>
                                    <li class="chapter"><strong class="procKeyword">replace </strong></li>
                                    <li class="chapter"><strong class="procKeyword">flag    </strong></li>
                                </ul>
                            </td>

                            <td>
                                <div class="insertContent"><div id="innerContainer">
                                    <div id="print" style="display: inline;">
                                        <strong>Definition: </strong><font id="definition">&ltPrint&gt := print &ltStackExpression&gt</font><br>
                                        <strong>Usage:      </strong> Prints its value to the console.<br><br>

                                        This is the first procedure we tackle, so let's look at a couple examples:<br>
                                        <div class="codeSnippet"><pre>
                                            print 2 &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp # this value is a NUMBER
                                            print "2" &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp# this value is a STRING
                                            print 1 2 "hi" 3 # these values are MANY >> [ 1, 2, hi, 3 ]
                                        </pre></div><br>
                                        As you can see in example #3, multiple values can share the same space with no separators.
                                        Moreover, since we aren't performing any operations on them that leaves us with many values to process,
                                        and when this happens what you obtain is a <strong>LIST</strong><br><br>

                                        To understand why this happens, we need to talk about the only (not entirely true) argument this procedure takes
                                        in: a <strong>Stack Expression</strong>:<br>
                                        Stack expressions are the way values are created, changed and manipulated in this language. Anytime a value is written,
                                        transferred, changed, calculated or even taken as an input from the user, it's bound to pass through a stack expression.<br>
                                        So how does it work?<br>
                                        Every time a stack expression argument is executed, 3 things happen in order:<br><br>

                                        1) An empty stack is created. A <strong>stack</strong> in computer science is a very common abstract data structure defined as a pile 
                                        of elements that can only be accessed from its "top", removing or adding one element at a time. In this particular implementation, many more
                                        operations are possible, however the core limitation of not being able to access any of the elements at a moment's notice is still present, and
                                        it makes for an original and compelling coding style.
                                        <br><br>
                                        
                                        2) All the items in the stack expression are evaluated in writing order. A direct consequence of using a stack to store values is what's known in
                                        Mathematics as <strong>Reverse Polish Notation</strong>, a particular way of writing expressions where each operator goes after all of its operands.<br>
                                        This means that to perform an addition we must first push both inputs on the stack, and only then the "+" follows.<br>
                                        Reverse polish notation ensures linear priority in evaluating mathematical and logical operations, making them always inequivocably objective.
                                        How many times have people been fooled by "simple operations" such as this one: <strong>1 + 12 / 2 * 3</strong> ? Does this equal 19 or 3? Depends who you ask,
                                        because "/" is a terrible way of indicating division given it's <strong>unclear</strong> what the numerator and denominator are.
                                        Most programming languages solve this problem by relying on parentheses, forcing you to use them everywhere in fear of messing up the
                                        order of operations in complex expressions. Here there are no parentheses, you don't need them, priority is <strong>linear</strong>.
                                        <br><br>
                                        
                                        3) decide how to "cast" the output based on its length: no &ltStackExpression&gt is ever allowed to end its evaluation empty in this language, but besides that
                                        if more than one element is left on the stack after all operations have performed, the return value of that &ltStackExpression&gt will be a list of all remaining elements
                                    
                                        A few examples:
                                        <div class="codeSnippet"><pre>
                                            print 1 2 + &nbsp&nbsp# >> 3
                                            print 1 "2" + # >> "12"
                                            print 1 2 3 &nbsp&nbsp# >> [ 1, 2, 3 ]
                                        </pre></div>
                                    </div>

                                    <div id="make" style="display: none">

                                </div></div>
                            </td>
                        </tr></table>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Function Calls:</strong> ??
