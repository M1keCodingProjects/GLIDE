        <h1>GAMELANG : an overview</h1>
        <div id="tutorialContent">
        Hi! This is meant as an introduction / explanation for my proof-of-concept language: <strong>GAMELANG</strong><br>
        Let's start with the basics:<br>
            <div id="section">
                <p id="sectionTitle">Whitespace</p>
                Spaces are the foundation of parsing for this language, an item (or "token") to be distinguishable from its neighbours must be well spaced out on both sides.<br>
                That said indentation is instead irrelevant, just like the <strong>amount</strong> of spaces you leave around your tokens.
            </div>

            <div id="section">
                <p id="sectionTitle">Types</p>
                GAMELANG is a dynamicly typed, interpreted and synchronous language with only four proper primitive types:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>NUMBER</strong> - GAMELANG does not distinguish between numbers and booleans, namely:<br>
                        0 ←→ false , 1 ←→ true.
                    </li>
                    
                    <li>
                        <strong>STRING</strong> - Currently, support for escaping characters is limited to "&new",
                        which replaces the much more common "\n".
                        <div id="codeSnippet">
                            <font id="string">"Hello, World!&newWhat's up?"</font>
                            <font id="comment"># >> Hello, World!
                            <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp#&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp What's up?
                            </font>
                        </div>
                    </li>
                    
                    <li>
                        <strong>LIST</strong> - A collection of indexable items, of any type (even other lists).
                    </li>
                    
                    <li>
                        <strong>OBJECT</strong> - A collection of "property : value" pairs that have to be indexed by name and are not positional.<br>
                        Object properties are more precisely called "methods" if their access operation corresponds to a "Function call", but we'll get
                        to that later.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                What you can also notice is the absence of a <strong>NULL</strong> type of sorts. In fact, such values aren't allowed in the language and while it's possible
                to create an empty string ("") similar structures for other types, such as an empty list ([]) or object ({}), are impossible to obtain.
            </div>

            <div id="section">
                <p id="sectionTitle">Expressions</p>
                Any line of code written in GAMELANG is called an <strong>Expression</strong>, of which there are 3 valid types:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Procedures:</strong> a procedure, like any other expression, follows a specific pattern of arguments and
                        syntactic rules. Most notably, it always begins with a <strong>keyword</strong>.<br>
                        This is a list of all currently available keywords:
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong><font id="procKeyword">print  </font></strong></li>
                            <li><strong><font id="procKeyword">make   </font></strong></li>
                            <li><strong><font id="procKeyword">free   </font></strong></li>
                            <li><strong><font id="procKeyword">when   </font></strong></li>
                            <li><strong><font id="procKeyword">else   </font></strong></li>
                            <li><strong><font id="procKeyword">options</font></strong></li>
                            <li><strong><font id="procKeyword">loop   </font></strong></li>
                            <li><strong><font id="procKeyword">next   </font></strong></li>
                            <li><strong><font id="procKeyword">exit   </font></strong></li>
                            <li><strong><font id="procKeyword">def    </font></strong></li>
                            <li><strong><font id="procKeyword">use    </font></strong></li>
                            <li><strong><font id="procKeyword">with   </font></strong></li>
                            <li><strong><font id="procKeyword">replace</font></strong></li>
                            <li><strong><font id="procKeyword">flag   </font></strong></li>
                            
                        </ul>
                        <strong>Definition: </strong><font id="definition">&ltPrint&gt := print &ltStackExpression&gt</font><br>
                        <strong>Usage:      </strong> Prints its value to the console.<br><br>

                        This is the first procedure we tackle, so let's look at a couple examples:<br>
                        <p id="codeSnippet">
                            <font id="procKeyword">print</font> <font id="number">2</font> <font id="comment">&nbsp&nbsp# this value is a NUMBER</font><br>
                            <font id="procKeyword">print</font> <font id="string">"2"</font> <font id="comment"># this value is a STRING</font><br>
                            <font id="procKeyword">print</font> <font id="number">1 2</font> <font id="string">"hi"</font> <font id="number">3</font> <font id="comment"># these values are MANY >> [ 1, 2, hi, 3 ]</font><br>
                        </p><br>
                        As you can see from example #3, multiple values share the same space with no separators.
                        Moreover, we aren't performing any operations on them, which results in having to deal with multiple (as the comment suggest: MANY) values.
                        When this happens what you obtain is a LIST.<br><br>

                        To understand why this happens, we need to talk about the only (not entirely true) argument this procedure takes in: a "StackExpression".<br>
                        Stack expressions are the way values are created, changed and manipulated in this language. Anytime a value is written, transferred, changed, calculated or even taken as an input from the user,
                        it is bound to pass through a stack expression.<br>
                        So how does it work?<br>
                        Every time a stack expression argument is executed, 3 things happen in order:<br><br>

                        1) An empty stack is created. This <br><br>
                        
                        2) evaluate all of the stack elements you wrote, in order: this means that operators such as "+" must go AFTER both its inputs were put on the stack.
                        this is called "polish notation", and ensures linear priority in evaluating mathematical and logical operations, making them always inequivocably
                        objective in terms of parsing. No liberties / conventions have been taken by me in developing a parser for &ltStackExpression&gts , everything is linear, clear, expected. #division example<br><br>
                        
                        3) decide how to "cast" the output based on its length: no &ltStackExpression&gt is ever allowed to end its evaluation empty in this language, but besides that
                        if more than one element is left on the stack after all operations have performed, the return value of that &ltStackExpression&gt will be a list of all remaining elements
                    
                        A few examples:
                        print 1 2 +    >> 3
                        print 1 "2" +  >> "12"
                        print 1 2 3    >> [ 1, 2, 3 ]
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Function Calls:</strong> ??
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Assignments:</strong> ??
                    </li>
                </ul>
